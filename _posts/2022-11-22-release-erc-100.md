### Release Overview

#### [fio.erc20](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.erc20/releases/tag/v1.0.0){:target="_blank"} - FIO Token Wrapping

FIO Wrapping enables FIO tokens to be used in rapidly growing Defi ecosystems such as Uniswap which rewards token holders for providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges.

This release includes an `unwrap` action on the [WFIO contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbEA269038Eb75BdAB47a9C04D0F5c572d94b93D5){:target="_blank"}. This action allows a user to unwrap their WFIO tokens back onto the FIO chain. The initial version only supports WFIO tokens wrapped to Ethereum. When WFIO tokens are unwrapped, an event is issued. Next, a set of oracles run by FIO validators detect the unwrapped tokens and transfer the equivalent amount of FIO to the given FIO Crypto Handle on the FIO chain.

After deployment of the contract the contract owner key was "burned" by transfeering ownership to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to insure the integrity of the contract. FIO renounced ownership of the FIONFT contract in [this transaction ](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8b8c6d4846fde42e8aaad5dc66988ea804f487e20e4078cf5f84fa2b0b288fc2){:target="_blank"}.

#### [fio.erc721](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.erc721/releases/tag/v1.0.0){:target="_blank"}- FIO Domain Wrapping

FIO Domains are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are owned by a FIO Public Key. FIO Domain NFT wrapping enables users to wrap their FIO Domain (e.g., @mydomain) to the Polygon chain. FIO Wrapping opens up new use cases for FIO Domains such as enabling FIO Domains to be traded on NFT trading sites like OpenSea.

This release includes an `unwrapnft` action on the [FIO NFT contract](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x3AB00687AE60EeA770498b59685174E3FC81C424){:target="_blank"}. This action allows a user to unwrap their wrapped FIO Domain NFTs back onto the FIO chain. The initial version only supports the wrapping of domains to the Polygon chain. When FIO Domain NFTs are unwrapped, an event is issued. Next, a set of oracles run by FIO validators detect the unwrapped Domain NFTs and transfer the originally wrapped FIO Domain to the given FIO Crypto Handle on the FIO chain.

After deployment of the contract the contract owner key was "burned" by transfeering ownership to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to insure the integrity of the contract. FIO renounced ownership of the FIONFT contract in [this transaction ](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xc2fc055e0b24781e1329a64eae51355c167246fc7c291a806d9ba3156d332fd9){:target="_blank"}.
