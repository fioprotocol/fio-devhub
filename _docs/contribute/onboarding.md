## How do I begin an employment relationship with the FIO foundation on the FIO protocol?

The tech team of the FIO protocol supports the following employment models:

* Freelancer
* Contractor
* Consultant
* Advisor
* Service provider

### Individuals
The FIO foundation employs individuals as self sovereign entities on both a part-time and full-time basis. This means that you will decide and propose the details of how, when, where, and why you will work with FIO. Your proposal must be accepted by the FIO planning committee.  (Refer to Create Your Worker Proposal, below.)

### Organizations, Teams or Companies
The FIO foundation also employs organizations that perform services required by the FIO protocol. This means that your company (or team) can enter into a relationship with the FIO protocol to perform necessary services required by the FIO protocol. A representative of the company or team will create a worker proposal with the details of how, when, where, and why the team will work, and this proposal must then accepted by the FIO planning committee. Your team can create a worker proposal for bounties, projects, initiatives, or even a new idea you may have for the FIO protocol. (Refer to Create Your Worker Proposal, below.)

### Payment Considerations
The FIO foundation pays in crypto currency and uses FIO requests as the mechanism of payment for all worker proposals. This necessitates that you will need to set up your crypto currency logistics to support using FIO requests. (Refer to Set Up Process for Payment, below.)

**Note:** This worker proposal based model of employment requires the self employed individual to be aware of, and manage the tax implications of being involved with the FIO protocol under the legal considerations of their residency. Please make sure you understand the necessary aspects of taxation, and regulations that apply to you where you live.

If you are an experienced engineer but new to crypto, our core team can help you learn and master the necessary details of self employment, benefits, and using crypto as payment. Please do not hesitate to contact a key contributor on the GitHub and begin your FIO involvement!
