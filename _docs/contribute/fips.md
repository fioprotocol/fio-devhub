# FIO Improvement Proposals (FIPs)

The FIO community proposes FIPs to suggest changes to the FIO protocol.  Everyone is encouraged to review existing FIPs and provide feedback.
## FIP Types
There are three types of  FIPS:
- **Core** - improvements requiring a consensus fork
- **Functionality** - improvements that add or modify functionality without need for consensus fork
- **Standard** - documents standards used in FIO Protocol 

## New FIP Process
Follow this process to propose an improvement to FIO:

- Users interested in proposing changes start by opening a Github issue and create a FIP draft there first to ask for feedback from the community.  USers are encouraged to use the fip-TEMPLATE.md as a starting point and to use existing FIPs as examples.
- Repo custodians will review the FIP PR and comment. Once comments have been addressed, the FIP will be merged to Master with the status Draft.
- Next, reach out to the community and solicit feedback on your FIP.
- The author will continue to update the FIP based on community feedback and submit pull requests as needed. Once the community has contributed and the FIP is ready, create a pull request to update the status to Accepted.
- Once repo custodians accept the FIP, the solution is developed and pull requests submitted to the relevant repo.
- After the code has been merged and deployed to Mainnet, the status will be changed to Final
