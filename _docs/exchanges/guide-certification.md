# Certification checklist

**FIO Token support**

-  Receive FIO Tokens to wallet using FIO Public Key
-  Send FIO Tokens using FIO Public Key
-  FIO transaction history is avaialable including sent FIO (including fees) received FIO

**FIO Crypto Handle**

If using a unique FIO Crypto Handle for each user:
-  Exchange has set up a FIO Crypto Handle
-  User can register a FIO Crypto Handle using other crypto
-  User can register additional FIO Crypto Handles
-  User can add bundles to their existing FIO Crypto Handles (replaces Renew Crypto Handle)

If using the same FIO Crypto Handle for each user:
-  User can register a new FIO Crypto Handle or 
  
**FIO Send**

-  User is able to attach a FIO Memo when both the sending and receving user have FIO Crypto Handles (optional)
-  User selects an invalid FIO Crypto Handle, results in error
-  User selects valid FIO Crypto Handle, but the Chain or Token Code has not been mapped for that FIO Crypto Handle, results in error
-  Additional parameters returned from a FIO Crypto Handle mapped to a [multi-level address]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integration-guide/handle-mapping#multi-level-addressing) are handled as expected

**Mapping blockchain public addresses**

-  User is able to connect their FIO Crypto Handle to their crypto/tokens
-  User is able to disconnect their FIO Crypto Handle
-  Disconnecting the main FIO wallet is disabled (see [Mapping Public Addresses]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integration-guide/handle-mapping))

**Receive to FIO Crypto Handle**

- From a different wallet, a user is able to enter a FIO Crypto Handle that has a connected Token and Chain code and send using the returned mapped address
- If the sender and receiver both have a FIO Crypto Handle, a FIO memo was included, and FIO OBT transaction was created, the receiving wallet should show the memo (optional)

**Sent FIO Requests**

-  User is able to send a FIO Request to a valid FIO Crypto Handle
-  User is able to add a memo when sending a FIO Request
-  User is able to view sent FIO Requests
-  Sent Requests show the FIO Crypto Handle of the recipient, the token being requested, the amount of the request, request memo, and the status of the request (requested, rejected, received)
-  User who sent Request is able to *cancel* the Request

**Received FIO Requests**

-  User is able to view pending FIO Requests
