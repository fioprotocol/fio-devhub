As a Delegated Proof of Stake blockchain, the FIO Protocol enables your exchange to participate in the economics and governance of block production either individually or by teaming up with other companies. Centralized exchanges will obtain FIO Tokens through the various elements described on this page and may also choose to vote with the tokens held on their exchange.

### FIO Integration Grant

Integration grants are available to exchanges that meet Foundation established minimum criteria.  Grants range from $10,000 value to $500,000 value depending on the user base of the exchange and in the sole discretion of the Foundation for Interwallet Operability.

### This is Your Protocol!

The FIO Protocol was structured specifically to enable companies that provide user-facing crypto solutions, like exchanges and wallets, to economically benefit from the protocol and have the opportunity to be involved in the governance of the protocol via their FIO Token vote. In addition, exchanges have the ability to get even more involved in FIO Protocol’s future by participating in various activities coordinated by the Foundation via an emerging decentralized autonomous consortia model or even serving on the Foundation’s Board of Directors.
