### Wallet Income from FIO Integration

#### Integration Grants

Integration grants are available to wallets that meet Foundation established minimum criteria.  Grants range from $10,000 value to $500,000 value depending on the user base of the application and in the sole discretion of the Foundation for Interwallet Operability.  In addition, the Foundation will sponsor a certain number of free FIO Crypto Handles (aka FIO Addresses) for your users and you'll receive approximately $1 in token income directly from the blockchain for each as described below.  

To apply for an Integration Grant and obtain more information [use this brief form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU4efavwLErmJyRb1T_w9CGGLEqip2kVp1JSH-pfV7WDF--A/viewform?usp=sf_link){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}.  

#### User Bounties

Wallets that complete integration of FIO Crypto Handle registration and include the ability to send and receive with FIO Crypto Handles currently earn FIO Tokens roughly equal to $1 for each user that registers a FIO Crypto Handle. And for grant qualified wallets, the Foundation for Interwallet Operability will sponsor a certain number of free FIO Crypto Handles for your wallet's users. You still earn the TPID fee even on those FIO Crypto Handles paid for by the Foundation.

In addition, if your wallet enables FIO Domain registration, you currently would obtain roughly $20 in FIO Tokens directly from the blockchain for user registrations for custom FIO Domains.

#### Technology Provider ID (TPID) Fees

10% of all FIO token fees from FIO Crypto Handles and Domains registered inside of a wallet or exchange are credited to the wallet or exchange through their TPID.

#### FIO Staking integration reward

FIO Staking offers a new incentive to wallets which lets them earn 11% of the staking reward paid out to their users. Check out [FIO Staking Developer Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/how-to/staking) for more details.

#### Block Production

The FIO Protocol automatically proxies the vote of FIO tokens held in self sovereign wallets to the company that build the wallet unless  a user takes action to vote those tokens themselves.  This  combined with the various other ways described on this page that wallets obtain FIO Tokens, enables wallets with large numbers of customers holding FIO tokens the ability to potentially participate in the economics of block production either individually or by teaming up with other companies.

#### Integration Airdrop 

Select wallets that are known to have large numbers of users may be eligible for an additional airdrop of FIO Tokens upon completion of a full FIO integration.

### Driving Additional Users for Wallets

#### FIO Crypto Handle Giveaways

Wallets that have integrated FIO Crypto Handle registration and the ability to send and receive with FIO Crypto Handles can participate in FIO Crypto Handle Giveaway campaigns. In these campaigns the Foundation for Interwallet operability pays the ~$2 per FIO Crypto Handle FIO Token fee on behalf of the wallet’s users for registering a FIO Crypto Handle. The wallet still receives a FIO roughly $1 TPID fee for these free FIO Crypto Handles.

#### Participation in Exchange Listing Marketing

When the FIO Token is listed on exchanges there are often marketing activities around the listing. Some of those may require the users to obtain a FIO Enabled wallet.  Once sufficiently integrated, your company’s wallet would be included on that list of wallets that users can select.  In the not distant future, some exchanges will be integrating FIO into their deposit withdrawal interface and users will need a FIO enabled wallet to utilize that capability. 

#### FIO Utilization Contests

Once FIO Request is integrating, the Foundation will sponsor campaigns encouraging users to use the FIO Request functionality whereby, by doing so, users are entered into drawings or contests where they can win prizes that may include FIO tokens or other crypto.  

#### Future Marketing Campaigns

There are many additional marketing activities around registering FIO Crypto Handles and utilizing FIO Requests that the Foundation is in process of planning.  FIO enabled wallets end up being the beneficiaries of these campaigns as users must have a FIO enabled wallet to participate. 

A Better User Experience Leads to More Users

Until moving tokens/coins in a decentralized manner is easy and worry free, crypto will never reach mass adoption.  The FIO Protocol’s goal is to enable companies like yours to do that be solving the problems that exist **between** wallets, exchanges, crypto payment processing platforms, Dapps, etc.  A rising tide lifts all boats.

### This is Your Protocol!

The FIO Protocol was structured specifically to enable companies that provide user facing crypto solutions like wallets to benefit economically from the protocol and to be able to be involved in governance of the protocol via their FIO token vote.  In addition, wallets have the ability to get even more involved in the FIO Protocol’s future by participating in various activities coordinated by the Foundation via an emerging decentralized autonomous consortia model or even serving on the Foundation Board of Directors.
