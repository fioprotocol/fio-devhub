### Wallet Income from FIO Integration

#### Integration Grants

Integration grants are available to wallets that meet Foundation established minimum criteria.  Grants range from $10,000 value to $500,000 value depending on the user base of the application and in the sole discretion of the Foundation for Interwallet Operability.  In addition, the Foundation will sponsor a certain number of free FIO Addresses for your users and you'll receive approximately $1 in token income directly from the blockchain for each as described below.  

To apply for an Integration Grant and obtain more information [use this brief form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU4efavwLErmJyRb1T_w9CGGLEqip2kVp1JSH-pfV7WDF--A/viewform?usp=sf_link){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}.  

#### User Bounties

Wallets that complete integration of FIO Address registration and include the ability to send and receive with FIO Addresses currently earn FIO Tokens roughly equal to $1 for each user that registers a FIO Address. And for grant qualified wallets, the Foundation for Interwallet Operability will sponsor a certain number of free FIO Addresses for your wallet's users. You still earn the TPID fee even on those FIO Addresses paid for by the Foundation.

In addition, if your wallet enables FIO Domain registration, you currently would obtain roughly $20 in FIO Tokens directly from the blockchain for user registrations fo custom FIO Domains.

#### Technology Provider ID (TPID) Fees

10% of all FIO token fees from FIO Addresses and Domains registered inside of a wallet or exchange are credited to the wallet or exchange through their TPID.

#### Block Production

The FIO Protocol automatically proxies the vote of FIO tokens held in self sovereign wallets to the company that build the wallet unless  a user takes action to vote those tokens themselves.  This  combined with the various other ways described on this page that wallets obtain FIO Tokens, enables wallets with large numbers of customers holding FIO tokens the ability to potentially participate in the economics of block production either individually or by teaming up with other companies.

#### Integration Airdrop 

Select wallets that are known to have large numbers of users may be eligible for an additional airdrop of FIO Tokens upon completion of a full FIO integration.

### Driving Additional Users for Wallets

#### FIO Address Giveaways

Wallets that have integrated FIO Address registration and the ability to send and receive with FIO Addresses can participate in FIO Address Giveaway campaigns. In these campaigns the Foundation for Interwallet operability pays the ~$2 per FIO Address FIO Token fee on behalf of the wallet’s users for registering a FIO Address. The wallet still receives a FIO roughly $1 TPID fee for these free FIO Addresses.

#### Participation in Exchange Listing Marketing

When the FIO Token is listed on exchanges there are often marketing activities around the listing. Some of those may require the users to obtain a FIO Enabled wallet.  Once sufficiently integrated, your company’s wallet would be included on that list of wallets that users can select.  In the not distant future, some exchanges will be integrating FIO into their deposit withdrawal interface and users will need a FIO enabled wallet to utilize that capability. 

#### FIO Utilization Contests

Once FIO Request is integrating, the Foundation will sponsor campaigns encouraging users to use the FIO Request functionality whereby, by doing so, users are entered into drawings or contests where they can win prizes that may include FIO tokens or other crypto.  

#### Future Marketing Campaigns

There are many additional marketing activities around registering FIO Addresses and utilizing FIO Requests that the Foundation is in process of planning.  FIO enabled wallets end up being the beneficiaries of these campaigns as users must have a FIO enabled wallet to participate. 

A Better User Experience Leads to More Users

Until moving tokens/coins in a decentralized manner is easy and worry free, crypto will never reach mass adoption.  The FIO Protocol’s goal is to enable companies like yours to do that be solving the problems that exist **between** wallets, exchanges, crypto payment processing platforms, Dapps, etc.  A rising tide lifts all boats.

### This is Your Protocol!

The FIO Protocol was structured specifically to enable companies that provide user facing crypto solutions like wallets to benefit economically from the protocol and to be able to be involved in governance of the protocol via their FIO token vote.  In addition, wallets have the ability to get even more involved in the FIO Protocol’s future by participating in various activities coordinated by the Foundation via an emerging decentralized autonomous consortia model or even serving on the Foundation Board of Directors.
