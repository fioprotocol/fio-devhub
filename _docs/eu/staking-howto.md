# How to Stake FIO

FIO Staking is an on-chain program which rewards users for participating in blockchain governance. It was developed as part of [FIP-21](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips/blob/master/fip-0021.md){:target="_blank"}. This section provides on overview of FIO Staking and describes how to stake your tokens.
