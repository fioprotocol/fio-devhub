# Building a node

There are a number of paths to set up a FIO Node. This section walks through several paths for different types of users. We encourage you to ask questions about block production, running an API node, and any other node-related questions in the [FIO Mainnet Telegram channel](https://t.me/fiomainnet){:target="_blank"}.

This section contains the following content:

|Content|Summary|

| [nodeos Replay]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chain/node-build-replay) |Instructions on speeding up node setup by replaying from a snapshot, blocks.log, or V1 History archive. |
| [Validating your node]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chain/node-build-validate) |Information on validating your node once you have it up and running. |
| [Summary Script]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chain/node-build-script) |Script to perform a manual installation of the FIO blockchain with optional snapshot/history startup. |
| [Install Cleanup]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chain/node-build-cleanup) | Instructions on how to remove a FIO installation and cleanup your node of FIO install artifacts. |
