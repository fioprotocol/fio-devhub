# Program Overview
The FIO bounty program, managed and funded by the Foundation, is focused on identifying issues and problems that can impact the entire ecosystem.  These could include: 
- Loss of User Funds
- Exposure of private information (keys, PII)
- Incorrect or inconsistent query results

However, vulnerabilities that are already known are not considered as in-scope of the bounty program, as well as other things listed as out-of-scope in the relevant section below. Bounty hunters submit vulnerability reports at their own risk of being rejected as a known issue.

These pages provide more information about the program:
