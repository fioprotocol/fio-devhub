# Rules and Requirements

We require that all researchers:

* When investigating a vulnerability, please, only ever target your own accounts. Never attempt to access anyone else’s data and do not engage in any activity that would be disruptive or damaging to your fellow users;
* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing;
* Perform research only within the scope set out below;
* Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; 
* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and FIO until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue;
* Only perform security research against a local node. Instructions for setting up a local node are available on the [Building a node]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chain/node-build) page; and
* If you want to perform research against the FIO Testnet, please engage with the [FIO Testnet Telegram group](https://t.me/fiotestnet){:target="_blank"} and ask for guidance.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
* Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within a reasonable amount of time); and
* Recognize your contribution (if requested), if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue.



# How to report a security vulnerability?

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in the FIO Protocol please send it to us by emailing security@fioprotocol.io Please include the following details with your report:

* Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and compressed screen captures are all helpful to us); and
* Your name/handle so we can respond to you (if desired).

If you’d like to encrypt the information, please use our Keybase key: https://keybase.io/fiosec
