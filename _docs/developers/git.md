# Git Branching and Release Strategy

|Branch |Purpose |Branch from |Naming |
|---|---|---|---|
|hotfix |Hotfix branches are for critical issues that need to get into Mainnet immediately. |release  |hotfix/<bug #>-<brief description> <br> (e.g., "hotfix/BD-1888-set-fee-ratio")  |
|release |Release branches are stable branches that are currently released, or have been previously released to Mainnet. The tip of this branch should be always in the production-ready state for that particular release. I.e., you should always be able to hotfix to a release branch. Release branches are created for every major and minor release. |master  |release/v1.1.x  |
|master |The master branch should always reflect what is on Mainnet. |release  | |
|develop |The develop branch serves as an integration branch for features/epics. |master  |  |
|bug |Bug branches  |develop, feature  |bug/bug#-description <br> (e.g., bug/BD-1841-wallet-requests )  |
|feature/epic |A feature (or epic) branch is the main unit of work. Features are developed in separate branches, promoted to testing, and then promoted to master in a continuous cycle. |develop  |feature/devname(optional)-epic#-fip#-epicname> <br> (e.g., "feature/eric-BD-1580-fip6-lock-tokens")  |

## Feature development

1. Create feature branch off of develop (e.g., feature/1580-fip6-lock-tokens)
2. Frequently rebase feature branch with latest from develop. This will grab the latest code and reattach the feature branch to the new root of develop.
3. Complete development of feature, SDK updates (if applicable), and javascript tests.
4. Run fio.test against local branch
5. Create draft PR
6. Send to QA
7. QA will expand javascript tests and open bugs
8.  Fix bugs and update PR
9.  Once it passes QA, install on DEV server and send to UAT
10. Once it passes UAT it will be sent to Ready to Deploy
11. Once a release target for feature has been identified:
    * Rebase feature branch from target and build locally
    * Re-run javascript tests on local build
    * Move PR from draft to review
12. Merge:
    * Feature branch into target branch
    * Merge SDK updates (if applicable)
    * Merge fio.test updates
13. Build target branch on DEV server and re-run JS tests

## Feature releases (major/minor releases)

1. The develop branch is the release candidate branch and and is used for release testing
2. Merge all features and bugs into develop
3. Rebase develop from master
4. Create draft PR to master
5. Install develop on DEV server
6. Run fio.test system tests
7. Create pre-release RC tag off of the head commit from develop
    * Tag: v1.1.0-rc1
    * Title: Release Candidate - FIO v1.1.0-rc1
8.  Send release to Testnet
9.  If issues are found, fix bugs off of develop branch as necessary and repeat steps with rc2, rc3, etc.
10. Complete Testnet testing
11. Move PR from draft to review
12. Merge develop into master
13. Create release branch (e.g., release/v1.1.x)
14. Install release branch on DEV server
15. Run JS tests
16. Create release from master
    * Tag: v1.1.0
    * Title: Release - FIO v1.1.0
17. Send release to Mainnet

## Hotfix/patch releases

1. Hotfixes branches are used to patch Mainnet.
2. Compare latest release branch (e.g., release/v1.1.x) with master. If there are differences, we have done something wrong.
3. Create hotfix branch off of release branch
4. Complete development and javascript tests for hotfix
5. Create PR and merge into release branch
6. Install release branch on DEV server and through QA/UAT cycle. Update release branch as necessary.
7. Create pre-release RC tag off of the head commit from release branch
    * Tag: v1.1.1-rc1
    * Title: Release Candidate - FIO v1.1.1-rc1
9.  Send release to Testnet
10. If issues are found, fix bugs off of release branch as necessary and repeat steps with rc2, rc3, etc.
11. Complete Testnet testing
12. Merge release branch into master
13. Create release from master:
    * Tag: v1.1.1
    * Title: Release - FIO v1.1.1
14. Send release to Mainnet.

## Archiving branches

When you want to keep the commit history of a branch that is old or that has been deprioritized, archive the branch as a tag and then remove the branch. Git tags aren't too different from branches. They are a point-in-time backup of a repository at a specific commit level or in the case of this workflow a specific branch.
