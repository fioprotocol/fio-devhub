# Documenting Changes for Deployment
Smart contract developers who have developed enhancements to the FIO protocol should consider several important deliverables: 

- The developer must at a minimum document the commands necessary to be executed on the previous version of the chain in order to deliver their changes
- The developer must summarize the necessary dependancies of any modified contracts:

- The developer should also clearly communicate changes that MUST go into the chain together.
