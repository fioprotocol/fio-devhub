# Tech Team Worker Proposal Checklist

## Who Should Use This Checklist

For the tech team serving the FIO protocol there is a core engineering team implemented. This team has budget from FIO approved and revised regularly. This team is led and managed by the VP of technology. Tech team members serve at the pleasure of the VP of technology. 

**Note**: Outside of the tech team there are fully decentralized models of servicing the FIO protocol put into practice. Entities may choose to submit worker proposals to complete desired work tasks and these will be reviewed approved based on the findings of the FIO planning committee.

This page aids in the creation/modification of new worker proposals that serve the FIO protocol in the areas of software, systems, contract, front end and other development facing efforts.  Contributions to the following areas should use this checklist:

* Devops
* Blockchain development
* Front end development
* API support
* Build/deployment support
* Quality assurance

## Identifying Information
